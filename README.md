# MIPS-32
TUC-N CTI-ro 30223 COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE, 2ND SEMESTER

This repository contains the implementation of a Multiprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline, running on an 32 bits ISA
created during the Computer Architecture laboratory at Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, under the direct supervision
of Dr. Eng. Constantin Nandra. 

This repository is intended to provide a better understanding of my abilities in developing a MIPS using a hardware
description language such as VHDL.
